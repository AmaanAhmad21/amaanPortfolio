# About page images (required for images to show)

Put these **three files** in this folder (`public/images/`) so the About page can display them:

| File name           | Section     | What to use |
|---------------------|------------|-------------|
| **western-logo.png** | School     | Western University logo (screenshot or download from uwo.ca) |
| **powerlifting.png** (or **powerlifting.jpg**) | Powerlifting | **Your deadlift photo** (the one you sent) |
| **ferrari-logo.png** | Formula 1  | Ferrari logo (the one you sent or any Ferrari emblem PNG) |

After you add the files, restart the dev server if the images don’t show right away.
